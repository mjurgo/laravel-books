# First laravel app - books

## Current agenda

- 

## TODO

- Authorize users.
- Create admin panel.
- Add search panel with laravel livewire.
- Refactor ratings. Maybe move rating download to user model? It would make more sense to do User->bookRating($book->id) than $book->currentUserRating. Maybe.
